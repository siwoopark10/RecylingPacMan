Recyclable Pac-Man

Purpose
This is a modified version of Pac-Man. Just like the regular Pac-Man, collect all of white pips distributed throughout the map to complete the game. The enemies are milk cartons but you can also recylce them by using the your items.

Movements
Use your up, down, left, right keys to move your pac-man through the app.

Item
Green recyclable sign that allows you to recyle your enemies for 5 seconds. You are going to hear a beeping sound which indicates the time you can eat the enemy.

Enemy
Avoid getting in contact with the milk cartons. They will cost you a life. However, if you collect the green recylcing item, then you are able to recycle the milk cartons for 5 seconds by eating (colliding with) them. The milk cartons will respawn in the middle of the map once you recycle them.

Points
White pip: 1 point
Milk Carton: 10 points
