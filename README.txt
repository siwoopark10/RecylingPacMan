Recyclable Pac-Man

Purpose
This is a modified version of Pac-Man. Just like the regular Pac-Man, collect all of white pips distributed throughout the map to complete the game. The enemies are the electronic wastes but you can also recylce them by using the your items.

Movements
Use your up, down, left, right keys to move your pac-man through the app.

Item
Green recyclable sign that allows you to recyle your enemies for 5 seconds. You are going to hear a beeping sound which indicates the time you can eat the enemy.

Enemy
Avoid getting in contact with the electronic devices (e-wastes). They will cost you a life. However, if you collect the green recylcing item, then you are able to recycle them for 5 seconds by eating (colliding with) them.

Points
White pip: 1 point
Recycled Electronic Waste: 10 points
